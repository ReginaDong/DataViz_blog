Step-by-step Guide3.1 Data preparation steps\r\n3.2 Data Visualization steps\r\n\r\n4. Final Visualization\r\n5. Major Observations\r\n\r\n1. Critiques for Original Visualization\r\nSingapore is a country with large volumes of import and export transactions with various countries/regions. In order to show the merchandise trade of ten major trading partners, below graph was originally designed as the visualization of import and export trade data provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS).\r\nFig.1 Original Visualization\r\nHowever, this graph is not a good visualization sample for this topic. I criticized above graph from two aspects, clarity and aesthetics, and explained the reason why it’s not good enough.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nClarity is to describe how quickly and effectively it imparts to the audience an accurate understanding of some fundamental truth about the real world. For the original graph, there are several points that I think is not meet the requirement of clarity.\r\nNo\r\nCritiques\r\n1\r\nOverlapped bubbles with opaque color and tag, make it difficult to see the size of some bubbles, such as Malaysia bubble that is almost blocked by EU and United States, or Korea bubble which is mostly covered by Japan. The audience can’t tell how big the bubbles of Malaysia and Korea are.\r\n2\r\nCan’t clearly tell whether some bubble centers fall in the area of net imports or net exports, cause some centers are covered or too close to the diagonal line. For example, the center of EU is blocked by United States, the center of Korea is blocked by Japan, and the center of Mainland China almost lies on the diagonal line, so it’s hard to determine which part of area the three countries belong to.\r\n3\r\nIt does not show what the figure on the labels exactly stand for. If it represents the total merchandise trade value, then no label shows specific values of trade surplus and deficit for each country, which is important information for the topic. The original graph only use some icons to show the top net exporter and importer without showing specific net trade amount between the singapore and partners\r\n4\r\nNo proper title or lead-in verbiage shows which period the graph and data represents. A proper title is very important to show the key topic of a graph, but this graph even don’t have a title. The lead-in verbiage also does not show the period of the graph.\r\n5\r\nNo option could let the audience select specific period to see the trade performance with different countries/regions in that period. The graph could only show the trade performance in a fixed period, but what if the audience want to see the data of a specific period.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe point of Aesthetic is to make the graph looks beautiful. Although the standard of “beauty” is different for everyone, at least we can think the visualization is more beautiful when the graph looks neat and clear, then audiences would like to pay more attention to the graph. In that case, some subtle adjustment is always matter, for example, font and color choices for the graph. Thus, I have came up with several points on why the original graph is not beautiful enough.\r\nNo.\r\nCritiques\r\n1\r\nThe bubbles and labels are represented by too many colors. Each bubble is linked with a label showing name of country/region and certain figure. But all bubbles and labels are in different colors and block each other, which makes the entire graph look too fancy and distracting. So the audience can’t focus on the key information the figure want to convey.\r\n2\r\nSome icons are not necessary to for the graph. For example the two icons next to the start point of axes. It won’t provide much valuable information but will distract the audience.\r\n3\r\nThe font color and size of the two paragraphs of text in the graph are different, which makes the graph look less concise. Both paragraphs of text represent some kind of annotation for the graph, but expressed in different font colors and sizes. And the text at the bottom is even placed in a blue box. All these inconsistencies will make the entire graph look untidy and distract the audience.\r\n2. Alternative Design\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\nThe following picture shows the initial design sketch for the visualization of above topic:\r\nFig.2 Sketch of alternative design\r\n2.2 Advantages of proposed design\r\nThe advantages and issues the proposed design try to overcome are listed below:\r\nNO.\r\nAspect\r\nAdvantages\r\n1\r\nClarity\r\nAdjust the size of bubbles and set some extend of transparency for the bubble colors, and show the label for bubbles only when the mouse hover over the bubbles, which could reduce the overlapped area, and the transparency makes it clear to see the size even if bubbles are overlapped.\r\n2\r\nClarity\r\nUse color to show whether the partner is net exporter or net importer. The bubbles and bar chart are blue when export trade amount of specific partner exceed import, otherwise they are in red color. In this case the audience could easily distinguish net exporters and net importers. Besides, the color saturation indicates how high the absolute value of each partner’s trade surplus or deficit is.\r\n3\r\nClarity\r\nAn extra bar chart is designed to show the concrete net trade amount and its rank. The bar chart could clearly show the net trade amount of each countries and the trading partners are sorted in descending order of the net trade values.\r\n4\r\nClarity\r\nAdd proper graph title, lead-in verbiage and reference line. This proposed design includes a proper title and description of the background, purpose and currency of visualization. It will give audiences a clearer recognition of information passed by the graph. Besides, some reference lines are added to show the average of factors.\r\n5\r\nClarity\r\nThe interactivity of the graph could give audiences the option to choose specific years. Set an interactive filter to see the trade performance in a specific year, also set the animation to show the track of value changes along with year changes, so that audiences could compare the amount between years.\r\n6\r\nClarity\r\nThe tooltip includes the specific amount and rank of trade for each trading partner, as well as the line chart of export and import amount during 2011 to 2020. Audience could see the tooltip if they want to know more details about the trade performance. Besides, the line chart can give audiences an intuitive feeling of how the values of export and import trade changes over time.\r\n7\r\nAesthetic\r\nSimple and consistent color scheme for the entire graph. The selected colors for the plot area look comfortable, and grid lines are in light gray which won’t distract the audience attention. Besides, the color scheme of bubble plot is aligned with the color used in bar chart and line chart.\r\n3. Step-by-step Guide\r\n3.1 Data preparation steps\r\nNO.\r\nStep\r\nAction\r\n1\r\nSelect the data to be imported in Tableau\r\nThe raw file downloaded contains export and import data of many countries/ regions since 1976 Jan, so the first step is select target countries/ regions’ data between 2019 Jan and 2020 December, copy the selection and paste with transposing into a new Excel workbook called “data_cleaned”, as shown below. The export and import data are pasted in different sheets, named “Export” and “Import” respectively.

Critiques for Original Visualization\r\nSingapore is a country with large volumes of import and export transactions with various countries/regions. In order to show the merchandise trade of six major trading countries/regions, below graph was originally designed as the visualization of import and export trade data provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS).\r\nFig.1 Original Visualization\r\nHowever, this graph is not a good visualization sample for this topic. I criticized above graph from two aspects, clarity and aesthetics, and explained the reason why it’s not good enough.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nClarity is to describe how quickly and effectively it imparts to the audience an accurate understanding of some fundamental truth about the real world. For the original graph, there are several points that I think is not meet the requirement of clarity.\r\nNo\r\nCritiques\r\n1\r\nInconsistent range of vertical axis scale. The range of vertical axis scales for each country/region and export/import do not remain the same, thus users can neither compare trading trends between countries/regions nor trade gaps between export and import within one country/region.\r\n2\r\nRough scale division of horizontal axis without tick marks. The label of horizontal axis only shows the year, and the scale division of horizontal axis is not detailed enough, though the horizontal axis title is called “Month of Period”, so it’s hard to see exactly which month or quarter the data belongs to.\r\n3\r\nMisleading label of horizontal axis. The last label of horizontal axis is 2021 for countries/regions except for Japan, whereas the only data in 2019-2020 is used for visualization, which will confuse audience exactly which periods of data are intended to show.\r\n4\r\nWrong chart type is used in this graph. The figures of export data are covered by the colored area of importing figures, which makes it hard to see the single trend of export or import trade for countries/regions, especially when export trade trend and import trade trend of a country/region are quite similar.\r\n5\r\nNo lead-in statement for the chart. A proper lead-in that provide proper background or further elucidation can give audiences clearer recognition of data, which is not included in the graph. Thus the audiences won’t know which currency the data are, how the data are selected for visualization, or the purpose of the graph.\r\n6\r\nImproper graph title. According to my calculation, Indonesia has the 6th highest total number of import and export trade with Singapore during 2019-2022, that is higher then Japan, as the following picture shows. Thus the graph title “Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries” is not quite proper. Fig.2 Sorting of countries/regions by total trade amount in 2019-2020\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe point of Aesthetic is to make the graph looks beautiful. Although the standard of “beauty” is different for everyone, at least we can think the visualization is more beautiful when the graph looks neat and clear, then audiences would like to pay more attention to the graph. In that case, some subtle adjustment is always matter, for example, font and color choices for the graph. Thus, I have came up with several points on why the original graph is not beautiful enough.\r\nNo.\r\nCritiques\r\n1\r\nThe chart horizontal axes are not in the same size. The length of horizontal axes are different for each country/region which makes the graph looks not neat enough.\r\n2\r\nThe number of axis label is not the same between each country/region and data labels are not aligned. For instance, Mainland China’s chart has 4 or 5 ladles for vertical axis and 3 for horizontal axis, whereas Japan’s chart has 3 labels for vertical axis and 1 for horizontal axis. And labels for both vertical and horizontal axis are not aligned. Thus the charts looks untidy.\r\n3\r\nThe font size of the graph title is smaller then the country/region titles. In this case audiences would notice the country/region titles instead of the graph title at the first glance, which is a bit distracting.\r\n4\r\nThe plot area overlaps too much. The colors of overlapped area look not good, and overlapped trend edges look messy.\r\n2. Alternative Design\r\n2.1 Sketch\r\nThe following picture shows the initial design sketch for the visualization of above topic:\r\nFig.3 Sketch of alternative design\r\n2.2 Advantages of proposed design\r\nThe advantages and issues the proposed design try to overcome are listed below:\r\nNO.\r\nAspect\r\nAdvantages\r\n1\r\nClarity\r\nConsistent range scale of vertical axis for import and export trade, and clear division of quarter and year in horizontal axis. Audiences can easily compare either the trading trade between different countries/regions, or the gap of import and export trade within a country/region, in particular quarters.\r\n2\r\nClarity\r\nCorrect and exact labels of horizontal axis. Now the horizontal axis labels show the correct period to be analyzed. And audiences can easily distinguish which quarter the values are belong to.\r\n3\r\nClarity\r\nDisplay the quarterly trade data point with different shapes and colors, and draw the bridge between export and import trade. Using different colors to show the country/region, and shapes to differentiate the trade type. Quarterly bridges are drawn between import and export data points, which makes it clearer to show and compare the gap of the two types of trade in each quarter.\r\n4\r\nClarity\r\nProper graph title, lead-in verbiage and annotations. This proposed design includes a proper title and description of the background, purpose and currency of visualization. It will give audiences a clearer recognition of information passed by the graph. Besides, some annotations could make audiences focus on special points.\r\n5\r\nAesthetic\r\nNeat and tidy layout of graph. All countries/regions are evenly assigned to separate paralleled panes. And the axis labels are all in the same numbers for each country/region.\r\n6\r\nAesthetic\r\nGood color matching and shape assortment without too much overlapped area. The selected colors and shapes for plot area look comfortable, and grid lines are in light gray which won’t distract the audience attention. Without too much overlapped area, the entire graph also looks cleaner.\r\n3.

Major Observations\r\nBelow list observations for this visualization and related interpretations:\r\nNO.\r\nObservations\r\nInterpretations\r\n1\r\nBoth maximum quarterly import and export trade amounts come from Mainland China, and it’s clearly shown that China hold the maximum total import and export amount during the two years, while Hong Kong hold the minimum import amount, both quarterly and yearly. However, the export trade to Hong Kong is relatively high compared to all other four countries/regions except for Mainland China, which makes Singapore have the largest gap between import and export trade with Hong Kong\r\nAs Mainland China is a big country with abundant nature resources and industries and near to Singapore, compared to another big country, US, it’s not surprise that Mainland China is the top one country that Singapore have merchandise trade with. On the other hand, Hong Kong is quite small region with developed financial industry and highly dependent on imported resources, thus it’s reasonable that Hong Kong doesn’t have much goods could be exported to Singapore.\r\n2\r\nSingapore’s merchandise trade amounts with some countries/ regions show seasonal trend, especially Mainland China, Taiwan and Japan.\r\nFor Mainland China, both export and import trade amount keep increasing for four quarters, while trade with Japan will decrease during quarter 2 and 3 then rebounds to some extend in quarter 4. These kinds of seasonal trend may be related to the types of merchandise Singapore trades with these countries/ regions.\r\n3\r\nThere are sudden changes for some trade countries/ regions in 2020. For example, the export trade with Mainland China increased sharply from the second quarter to the third. But the export trade amount with US exceed import trade since the second quarter, and both trade keep decreasing from the second quarter to the third.\r\nThis abnormal changes may caused by COVID-19. As the epidemic situation is most serious during the first two quarters in Mainland China and mitigated since May, thus the export trade to Mainland China also recovered since that. While US encountered serious epidemic since the second quarter thus trade amount decrease since that period. Besides, we can speculate that COVID-19 has caused severer influence to export trade with Mainland China than import trade, since the changes in export is much more obvious. On the contrary, import trade with US has been affected more than export trade by COVID-19, as import amount went further down in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
