# 1. Critiques for Original Visualization

Singapore is a country with large volumes of import and export transactions with various countries/regions. In order to show the merchandise trade of ten major trading partners, below graph was originally designed as the visualization of import and export trade data provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS).

![](img/img01_ori.jpg)
_Fig.1 Original Visualization_

However, this graph is not a good visualization sample for this topic. I criticized above graph from two aspects, clarity and aesthetics, and explained the reason why it's not good enough.

### 1.1 Clarity

Clarity is to describe how quickly and effectively it imparts to the audience an accurate understanding of some fundamental truth about the real world. For the original graph, there are several points that I think is not meet the requirement of clarity.

**No** | **Critiques**
-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      | **Overlapped bubbles with opaque color and tag, make it difficult to see the size of some bubbles**, such as Malaysia bubble that is almost blocked by EU and United States, or Korea bubble which is mostly covered by Japan. The audience can't tell how big the bubbles of Malaysia and Korea are.
2      | **Can't clearly tell whether some bubble centers fall in the area of net imports or net exports**, cause some centers are covered or too close to the diagonal line. For example, the center of EU is blocked by United States, the center of Korea is blocked by Japan, and the center of Mainland China almost lies on the diagonal line, so it's hard to determine which part of area the three countries belong to.
3      | **It does not show what the figure on the labels exactly stand for.** If it represents the total merchandise trade value, then no label shows specific values of trade surplus and deficit for each country, which is important information for the topic. The original graph only use some icons to show the top net exporter and importer without showing specific net trade amount between the singapore and partners
4      |**No proper title or lead-in verbiage shows which period the graph and data represents.** A proper title is very important to show the key topic of a graph, but this graph even don't have a title. The lead-in verbiage also does not show the period of the graph.
5      |**No option could let the audience select specific period to see the trade performance with different countries/regions in that period.** The graph could only show the trade performance in a fixed period, but what if the audience want to see the data of a specific period.

### 1.2 Aesthetic

The point of Aesthetic is to make the graph looks beautiful. Although the standard of "beauty" is different for everyone, at least we can think the visualization is more beautiful when the graph looks neat and clear, then audiences would like to pay more attention to the graph. In that case, some subtle adjustment is always matter, for example, font and color choices for the graph.  Thus, I have came up with several points on why the original graph is not beautiful enough.

**No.**| **Critiques**
-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      |**The bubbles and labels are represented by too many colors.** Each bubble is linked with a label showing name of country/region and certain figure. But all bubbles and labels are in different colors and block each other, which makes the entire graph look too fancy and distracting. So the audience can't focus on the key information the figure want to convey.
2      |**Some icons are not necessary to for the graph.** For example the two icons next to the start point of axes. It won't provide much valuable information but will distract the audience. 
3      |**The font color and size of the two paragraphs of text in the graph are different, which makes the graph look less concise.** Both paragraphs of text represent some kind of annotation for the graph, but expressed in different font colors and sizes. And the text at the bottom is even placed in a blue box. All these inconsistencies will make the entire graph look untidy and distract the audience.


# 2. Alternative Design

### 2.1 Sketch

The following picture shows the initial design sketch for the visualization of above topic:

![](img/Sketch2.jpg) <br> _Fig.2 Sketch of alternative design_

### 2.2 Advantages of proposed design

The advantages and issues the proposed design try to overcome are listed below:

**NO.**|**Aspect**      |**Advantages**
-------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      |Clarity         |**Adjust the size of bubbles and set some extend of transparency for the bubble colors, and show the label for bubbles only when the mouse hover over the bubbles**, which could reduce the overlapped area, and the transparency makes it clear to see the size even if bubbles are overlapped.
2      |Clarity         |**Use color to show whether the partner is net exporter or net importer.** The bubbles and bar chart are blue when export trade amount of specific partner exceed import, otherwise they are in red color. In this case the audience could easily distinguish net exporters and net importers. Besides, the color saturation indicates how high the absolute value of each partner's trade surplus or deficit is.
3      |Clarity         |**An extra bar chart is designed to show the concrete net trade amount and its rank.** The bar chart could clearly show the net trade amount of each countries and the trading partners are sorted in descending order of the net trade values.
4      |Clarity         |**Add proper graph title, lead-in verbiage and reference line.** This proposed design includes a proper title and description of the background, purpose and currency of visualization. It will give audiences a clearer recognition of information passed by the graph. Besides, some reference lines are added to show the average of factors.
5      |Clarity         |**The interactivity of the graph could give audiences the option to choose specific years.** Set an interactive filter to see the trade performance in a specific year, also set the animation to show the track of value changes along with year changes, so that audiences could compare the amount between years.
6      |Clarity         |**The tooltip includes the specific amount and rank of trade for each trading partner, as well as the line chart of export and import amount during 2011 to 2020.** Audience could see the tooltip if they want to know more details about the trade performance. Besides, the line chart can give audiences an intuitive feeling of how the values of export and import trade changes over time.
7      |Aesthetic       |**Simple and consistent color scheme for the entire graph.** The selected colors for the plot area look comfortable, and grid lines are in light gray which won't distract the audience attention. Besides, the color scheme of bubble plot is aligned with the color used in bar chart and line chart.

# 4. Final Visualization

The final visualization proposed is displayed as below:

![](img/Dashboard.jpg) <br> _Fig.69 Snapshot of final dashboard - Bubble plot and Bar chart_

The sorting of major trade partners in bar chart will change in descending order of net trade value automatically when select a year, so can clearly compare the net trade amount between trade partners in the specific year.

When hovering over cursor on the bubble, the tooltip with line chart will pop up, which indicates how export and import trade amount in the selected market change along time.

![](img/Dashboard_line.jpg) <br> _Fig.70 Snapshot of final dashboard - Line chart_

Full visualization is available at [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dong.fang.regina/viz/DataVizMakeover2_16239465641540/Dashboard1).


# 5. Major Observations

Below list observations for this visualization and related interpretations:

**Insight 1:** From the view of 10 years in total, Hong Kong had the highest net export trade amount, while Taiwan holding the highest net import trade amount.

Although Hong Kong and Taiwan has the highest net export and import trade amount respectively, they don't have much higher total trading amount seeing the bubble size. 

![](img/in1-1.jpg) 
_Fig.71 Snapshot of ten year total trading performance_ <br>

And if see the specific export and import trade amount, we can find Hong Kong has the lowest ranking of import, and quite high ranking of export, and the trade amount is quite stable with in the ten years. On the other hand, Taiwan has relatively low ranking of export.
